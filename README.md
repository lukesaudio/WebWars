**WebWars is a physics based simulation of two websites fighting.** Have you ever wondered which website is stronger in a 1 vs 1 automated physics based fight? Now you can see that with your own eyes. The main idea of the simulation si two see which one of two websites the player chooses wins in a solo fight. The stats of the fighters are provided by [Majestic](https://majestic.com/) and their api and are tied to the websites they represent. The jump speed, height or force for example are all influenced by the websites stats. The whole game was developed in 24 hours at the [HackTheMidlands](http://hackthemidlands.com/) hackathon in [Birmingham, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham).

# Download the game/project

We made it easy for you to download and get started with the game. All you have to do is `git clone https://github.com/tymscar/WebWars`

# Play the game

After the game is downloaded, execute the included `WebWars\webwarsgame\webwars.exe` file and you are ready to go.
The first thing you are going to see is the character select menu. Here, you can select the two websites that are going to battle. Enter their url in the white boxes.
When this is done the battle begins. The `Blue` player is on the left and the `Green` player is on the right. The battle begins. When one of the characters die, the other one is crowned the winner. Try this with all your favourite websites!

# Controls

Being more of a data visualisation app than an actual game, there are no other controls than entering the websites addresses at the start fo the game. 

# Changing the game

To look through the Unity3D project, we have also included all the file neccesary as well as the assets and scenes. All copyrights belong to their respective owners.

# Technical Details

The game is made in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) using the [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) game engine.
The player models and any other graphical assets are made in [Photoshop](www.adobe.com/Photoshop).
